### SCOPE

In this project i would like to answer all the questions from Curbal's '25 Days of DAX Fridays! Challenge â€“ Ed1: NorthWind Company' (https://curbal.com/25-days-of-dax-fridays-challenge-ed1-northwind-company) using Malloy. Now in this challenge all the required answers are in form of single numeric value or string - i won't be returning tables here and i won't be able to show some of Malloy's key concepts (like reusing queries, nesting and many more). So this notebook is begginer's level.

https://github.com/graphql-compose/graphql-compose-examples/tree/master/examples/northwind/data/csv .
When using csv or parquet files DuckDb is used as underlying engine (currently Malloy can be used also with BigQuery or Postgres). Csv files were transformed to parquet files (this can be visible in **DataTransformation.malloysql** notebook).

Dataset consists of 11 tables (2 tables are missing from original schema: customer_customer_demo and customer_demographics).

This is how original schema looks like: (from https://github.com/yugabyte/yugabyte-db/wiki/Northwind-Sample-Database)

Model is more or less ready. In some of the sources we can spot dimensions and measures - most of these were added later, while answering questions.
