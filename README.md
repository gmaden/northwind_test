Mini project : testing Malloy language on Northwind dataset by answering Curbal's 25 Days of DAX.

For this project i am using CSV files containing Northwind database data. Files come from https://github.com/graphql-compose/graphql-compose-examples/tree/master/examples/northwind/data/csv

Project assumptions:
1. Create data model in Malloy
2. Use Malloy notebook for the whole project
3. Try to answer questions from Curbal's '25 Days of DAX Fridays! Challenge â€“ Ed1: NorthWind Company' ( https://curbal.com/25-days-of-dax-fridays-challenge-ed1-northwind-company ) using Malloy and compare it with the way DAX language works. 

Notebook can be accessed using browser version of Vscode on .malloynb file (enter the file and press '.' on your keyboard).

The source to learn about Malloy language:

I highly advise to visit Slack channel where Malloy's creators quickly answer all questions:
