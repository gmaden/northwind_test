Mini project : testing Malloy language on Northwind dataset.

For this project i am using CSV files containing Northwind database data. Files come from https://github.com/graphql-compose/graphql-compose-examples/tree/master/examples/northwind/data/csv

Project assumptions:
1. Create data model in Malloy
2. Use Malloy notebooks for the whole project
3. Try to answer questions from Curbal's '25 Days of DAX Fridays! Challenge â€“ Ed1: NorthWind Company' ( https://curbal.com/25-days-of-dax-fridays-challenge-ed1-northwind-company ) using Malloy. Compare it with the way DAX language works. 

Notebook can be accessed using browser version of Vscode on .malloynb file.
